# Development Strategy

## WireFrame

> link to your wireframe.cc wireframe. (you can ignore the evaluation buttons in your wireframe)

## Steps Plan

> add one row to this table for each user story you define

| _Step Name_ | User Story | Changes in HTML | Changes in CSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Live Boilerplate__ | As an enthusiastic HYF student I can navigate to an empty website so that I know the project is set up correctly | An empty template project with `doctype`, language, charset, `head` & `body`, and evaluation script | an empty main `style.css` and an existing evaluation style |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| (descriptive name) | (user story) | (what did you add to the HTML?) | (what did you add to the CSS?) |
